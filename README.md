# M6---AWS-MLflow
3rd assignment

*Please note that the pictures are the result of this assignment. We closed the instante in AWS in order to avoid not expected costs. Increasing the accuracy was not the main focus in this project. We also created a MLflow application to track the model. We followed the structure learned in class, which is as follows:*

# Data Layer: Setting up SQLite  

# Business Layer: Training the Machine Learning Model

# Presentation Layer: HTML & CSS

# Connecting everything with Flask

# MLflow
